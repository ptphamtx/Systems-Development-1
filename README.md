# Technical Maintenance Document – Pam’s Barber Shop

This document outlines the procedures and responsibilities for maintaining the IT systems at Pam’s Barber Shop, a small business located in Plano, Texas, with 8 employees and a single shop location. The IT setup is modest but critical to daily operations, consisting of two Windows 11 laptops (used for appointments and accounting), one Square POS terminal for transactions, a Wi-Fi router and firewall, and a network printer. Since the shop processes credit card payments, the system must meet basic PCI DSS compliance requirements.

Daily maintenance involves simple but essential checks. Staff verify that the Square POS terminal is online before the shop opens and that the internet connection is stable, as downtime directly impacts sales. The Wi-Fi router (a TP-Link Archer AX55) is checked for connectivity, and automatic cloud backups through OneDrive are reviewed on the office laptop. If any device shows unusual slowness or fails to connect, the issue is reported immediately to the IT support contractor.

Weekly maintenance focuses on security and updates. Windows laptops are checked to confirm that Microsoft Defender is running and that virus definitions are no older than 48 hours. Staff also ensure that the router’s firewall is enabled, with the guest Wi-Fi separated from the business network. Operating system updates are applied every Friday evening after business hours, and Square transaction logs are quickly reviewed to confirm there are no anomalies, such as multiple declined payments for the same card.

Monthly maintenance includes reviewing the system for performance and security. The shop manager ensures that all devices have the latest Windows security patches installed and runs a malware scan on both laptops. A backup test is performed by restoring a file from OneDrive to confirm that data can be recovered if needed. Printer logs are cleared, and the network router is restarted to refresh its cache. Staff also change the Wi-Fi password once every three months to limit unauthorized access.

Quarterly maintenance adds more strategic checks. The IT support contractor performs a vulnerability scan on the laptops and POS system, using tools like ShieldsUP to verify that no unnecessary ports are exposed to the internet. The contractor also reviews user accounts and disables any that are no longer in use (for example, if a former employee’s email account is still active). A short disaster recovery drill is performed, where the team simulates a laptop failure and ensures they can still access appointment schedules from the cloud.

Roles and responsibilities are kept simple. The shop manager, Pam, is responsible for daily and weekly checks, while the IT contractor, John Smith of Smith Tech Services, handles monthly and quarterly maintenance tasks. All actions are recorded in a simple logbook kept in the office drawer. If a critical issue occurs, such as the POS terminal failing or the Wi-Fi being down, Pam contacts John directly, and the incident is resolved within 24 hours under the support agreement.

This structured but lightweight maintenance plan ensures that Pam’s Barber Shop keeps its essential IT systems secure, reliable, and compliant without requiring a full-time IT staff. By performing small, regular tasks and keeping records, the business can minimize disruptions and protect customer data, while keeping costs predictable and manageable for a small business.
